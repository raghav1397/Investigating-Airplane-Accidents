# Investigating Airplane Accidents

Accidents are an unfortunate fact of air travel. Although flying is statistically safer than driving, minor and major flying accidents occur daily. In this project, we'll work with a data set of airplane accident statistics to analyze patterns and look for any common threads.

We'll be working with a data set that contains 77,282 aviation accidents that occurred in the U.S., and the metadata associated with them.
